# ETL Project

## Finding Data
Two sources of data:
* United Health Foundation, _America's Health Rankings_: https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual
* Wallet Hub: _Happiest states in America_: https://wallethub.com/edu/happiest-states/6959/

## Data Cleanup & Analysis
Perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that you will extract from:
 ..1. United Health Foundation, _America's Health Rankings_: https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual
 ⋅⋅* Wallet Hub: _Happiest states in America_: https://wallethub.com/edu/happiest-states/6959/
* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
  ⋅⋅* Cleaning
  ⋅⋅* Filtering
* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
  ⋅⋅* Relational
* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
* You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.

## Project Report
Submit a Final Report that describes the following:

* Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
* Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
* Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.

Please upload the report to Github and submit a link to Bootcampspot.
